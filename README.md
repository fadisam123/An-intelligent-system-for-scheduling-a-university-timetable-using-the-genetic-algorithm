## An Intelligent System for Scheduling a University Timetable Using the Genetic Algorithm

### Overview

- This is a web-based application with dumy data in the database. You can clear the data and edit it as you want.

- There is also a console program in the attachments, which is an implementation of the genetic algorithm that is used to test the process of generating a timetable before moving to develop the main web-based application.

- To use the application, all you have to do is download it and run it either through the VS IDE or through the CMD command window.

- The **desired goals** of generating the timetable (i.e., what have been optimized in the genetic algorithm) are to **[1]** generate a schedule that is free of conflicts or contradictions at all levels (hard constraint), **[2]** fulfills the teachers desires for preferred times and rooms (soft constraint), and **[3]** reduces the waiting time between lectures for students (soft constraint).

- Please note that there are 4 types of users: *[1]* Admin, *[2]* Professor Head of Department, *[3]* Professor, and *[4]* Teacher (i.e. laboratory department). Each type can log in and use the application with the permissions assigned to it.

- Login is through a username and password. Below are the usernames and passwords for each type :

#### Login data
##### Admin
User Name: `admin`.
Password: `aaaaaa`.
##### Head of Department
User Name: `u1` --> `u3` (i.e. you can pick any one: u1, u2 or u3).
Password: `111111`.
##### Professor
User Name: `u4` --> `u10`.
Password: `111111`.
##### Teacher
User Name: `u11` --> `u19`.
Password: `111111`.

### Roles
- Teachers of all types (department head, professor, teacher) can choose their preferred times to teach their assigned courses and can choose their preferred rooms as well.

- Some of the Admin privileges are:
	 1. Generating the schedule (timetable), modifying it, deleting it, etc.
	 2. Opening the questionnaire for each type of the system (by questionnaire I mean the period during which teachers of all types can choose their preferred times and rooms).
	 3. Enter data into the system of the establishment (university, institute, school, etc.), such as the number of classes per year, official working hours or classes, data of teachers and their types, courses, rooms, etc.)
	 4. Creating or modifying user accounts (for login, forgetting password, etc.).
